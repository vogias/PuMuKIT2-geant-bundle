# GEANT-OER Project: GeantWebTVBundle

Bundle based on [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) to work with the [PuMuKIT2 Video Platform](https://github.com/campusdomar/PuMuKIT2/blob/2.1.x/README.md).

This bundle overrides the [PuMuKIT-2 WebTV Bundle](https://github.com/campusdomar/PuMuKIT2/tree/master/src/Pumukit/WebTVBundle). It has been developed as the Web portal for the Geant-OER project, whose goal is the creation of an European repository of educational multimedia resources for learning.

Steps 1 and 2 requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
in the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
of the Composer documentation.


### Step 1: Introduce repository in the root project composer.json

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
following command to add this repo:

```bash

following command to download the latest stable version of this bundle:

```bash
$ composer require teltek/pmk2-geant-webtv-bundle dev-master
```


### Step 3: Install the Bundle

.
