   <!--  <h2>FAQ's</h2>
    <strong>Q: Why have DANTE and TERENA joined forces?</strong>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> The decision to restructure came from the community of European NRENs (national research and education networking organisations), which both DANTE and TERENA serve. In October 2012 the community agreed it needed a strategy in order to achieve its part in the European Commission’s vision for the future of research and innovation, ‘Horizon2020’. This agreement followed the presentation of a report by the Reykjavik Group, which had been formed in May 2012 to prepare a response to recommendations published in 2011 in the report <a href="http://www.terena.org/about/ga/ga36/GA%2811%29024geg-report.pdf">'Knowledge without Borders'</a> - which was produced by the GÉANT Expert Group set up by the European Commission. More information about the various steps in this process are available via the TERENA news item:<a href="http://www.terena.org/news/3723/fullstory"> TERENA General Assembly hears satisfaction results and adopts new statutes.</a></p>

    <p>The restructuring also addresses the fact that DANTE and TERENA had differing governance structures and procedures, although serving largely the same set of NRENs. The main expected benefits of this restructuring are simplified governance, more efficient management, more flexible use of resources and a more inclusive membership. Members, services, operations and relationships with partners and related communities should see no adverse effects. Indeed, this restructuring will lead to more effective implementation of the community's strategy and strengthen the European research and education networking community as a whole.</p>

    <strong>​Q: How long is the restructuring process going to take?</strong>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Following a gradual build-up in discussions since 2010, the decision to restructure DANTE and TERENA to form the GÉANT Association was taken on 7 October 2014. The Interim CEO of the GÉANT Association has been named as Bob Day, Executive Director of Janet, the United Kingdom’s NREN. The association’s board asked him, as he steps down as chair of DANTE, to take on this new role during the period of transition and integration. An exact timetable for this process is not yet known, but, in the meantime, all the work and activities of the staff are continuing as before.</p>

    <strong>​Q: Why use the GÉANT name and similar branding for the new association when it is already used for the GÉANT Project - isn't this confusing?</strong>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> The members of the association agreed on 7 October to adopt the GÉANT name. The GÉANT project is the largest of the collaborative activities in which many NRENs and other R&amp;E networking organisations work together and have done so for many years with great success. The GÉANT name and brand have become well known around the world. To many people outside Europe, they were already synonymous with the European R&amp;E networking community and its collaborative work. The association's members recognised that the GÉANT name provides a strong position upon which the association can build towards further future successes. This will happen not only through what we currently know as the GÉANT Project, but also through the continuation of the many other collaborative activities that DANTE and TERENA have been busy with for many years.</p>​

    <p>​Because there is clearly a relationship between the long-standing GÉANT Project and the newly formed GÉANT Association, this needs to be apparent through their branding. However, the association deserves recognition in its own right and, to help minimise confusion, some distinctions have been made between the two brands. The project logo is unchanged apart from the addition of the word 'project', while the association's logo has removed the stars.</p><p>​

    </p><p>​The relationship between these brands is expected to evolve over an extended period of time. This transition will require a phased approach to how the association presents itself and all its activities, including the GÉANT Project. While every effort will be made to minimise confusion during the transition period, the GÉANT Association staff and management team recognise that some confusion is possible and ask for your patience and understanding as this process unfolds. </p>​

    <strong>Q: How will the restructuring affect the service / project / task force / other activities that I participate in?</strong>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> It is envisaged that all of the work areas undertaken by and within DANTE and TERENA will continue within the new GÉANT Association, at least to begin with. This includes the GÉANT Project, other network projects, task forces, collaborative groups and services. The purpose of the restructuring was not to cut down on TERENA and DANTE staff - staff support for all these work areas will therefore continue to be available. The GÉANT Association staff, management and governing bodies hope that there will be minimal impact on our community and users, or on their experience as a participant in / customer of our services and activities.</p>​

    <strong>Q: If I have questions about the restructuring process or its possible impacts on the community or activities, whom should I contact?</strong>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> If you have any specific concerns or questions regarding a particular service, group or activity, please ask the responsible member of staff with whom you normally liaise. If you do not know who the responsible member of staff is, or if you have a more general question, please contact: <a href="mailto:info@geant.org">info@geant.org</a></p><p>​

        <strong>​​Q: When will the permanent website be ready?</strong>
    </p><p><strong>A:</strong> This temporary website will be replaced with the first version of our long-term website from TNC15, the annual networking conference, which will be held in Porto, Portugal from 15-18 June 2015. That's where we aim to launch the new website and celebrate the formation of the GÉANT Association with our community.</p>​</div>  -->
